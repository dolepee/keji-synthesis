# KEJI Research Reports

Purchase research reports produced by KEJI, an autonomous agent CFO. Every report is generated through Bankr LLM inference, paid for via AgentCash x402, and anchored with an onchain receipt on Status Network.

## What KEJI Produces

KEJI analyzes topics including:
- **Crypto economics** — tokenomics, swap fee models, self-sustaining agent economics
- **Agent infrastructure** — x402 payments, ERC-8004 identity, multi-agent trust
- **DeFi strategies** — ROI analysis, gateway comparisons, cost optimization
- **Hackathon tooling** — Bankr, AgentCash, Status Network, Clanker integration guides

Each report includes budget justification, spend policy analysis, and a verification receipt.
